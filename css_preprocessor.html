        <h2>1. What does a CSS Preprocessor do?</h2>
        <p>A CSS preprocessor extends CSS with additional features, such as variables, nested rules, and functions, that make writing and maintaining stylesheets more efficient. It allows developers to write more organized and modular CSS code, which is then compiled into regular CSS for browsers to understand.</p>

        <h2>2. What are the advantages of using a CSS Preprocessor?</h2>
        <p>Some of the key advantages include:
            <ul>
                <li>Code organization: Helps organize CSS with features like nesting and modularization.</li>
                <li>Variables: Allows for the reuse of values like colors, fonts, and sizes.</li>
                <li>Functions and Mixins: Reusable code snippets and functions reduce redundancy.</li>
                <li>Maintainability: Easier to update styles across large projects.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>3. What are the disadvantages or issues you need to consider when using a CSS Preprocessor?</h2>
        <p>Some potential disadvantages include:
            <ul>
                <li>Learning curve: Developers need to understand the syntax and features of the preprocessor.</li>
                <li>Compilation: The preprocessor code must be compiled into standard CSS, adding an extra step to the development process.</li>
                <li>Performance: The final compiled CSS can become large and less efficient if not managed properly.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
